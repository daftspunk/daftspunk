        <h5>What on earth is <em>daft spunk</em>?</h5>
        <p>It's my alternate call sign to my original nickname <strong>spunky</strong>, named after the dimwitted dog from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocko's_Modern_Life" target="_blank">Rocko's Modern Life</a>. I've been using it for a long time now, almost 15 years.</p>
        <p>The nickname came about on IRC when I repeatedly discovered spunky was already taken. I also loved daft punk back in 1999, so the name "daft spunk" just kind of stuck with me.</p>
